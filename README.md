# Product Management API Documentation

Welcome to our Product Management API documentation! This guide outlines the various API endpoints available for managing product data within our system.

## Adding Products via POST Request

To streamline the process of adding products to our system, we've implemented a POST request method. This allows for efficient and structured addition of new products. Follow the steps below to successfully add products:

1. **Send a POST Request**: Utilize the designated endpoint for adding products. Ensure that your request is formatted correctly according to the API documentation.
2. **Provide Product Information**: Include all necessary details about the product in the request body. This typically includes attributes such as name, description, price, and any additional metadata required by the system.
3. **Handle Response**: Upon successful submission of the POST request, the system will respond with a confirmation message or relevant status code. Ensure to handle any errors or exceptions gracefully.
4. **Verify Product Addition**: After receiving a success response, verify that the product has been successfully added to the system by querying the relevant endpoint or checking the database.

## Product Data Validation and Retrieval

### Validation with Zod

We've implemented data validation using Zod, a powerful TypeScript schema validation library. This ensures that the product data submitted to our system adheres to specified schemas, maintaining data integrity and consistency.

### Retrieval APIs

1. **GET API for All Products**

    Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of all products available in our system. This allows for easy browsing and exploration of the entire product catalog.

    Endpoint: `/api/products`

2. **GET API for Single Product by ID**

    Fetch detailed information about a specific product by providing its unique identifier (ID). This endpoint enables targeted retrieval of product details based on individual requirements.

    Endpoint: `/api/products/{product_id}`

    Replace `{product_id}` with the actual ID of the product you wish to retrieve.

## Update Product Data via API

To keep product information accurate and up-to-date, we've implemented an update API. This API allows for seamless modification of product data as needed. Follow the instructions below to update product information:

### Update Product Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `/api/products/{product_id}`

Replace `{product_id}` with the unique identifier of the product you wish to update.

### Request Method

Send a PUT request to the designated endpoint with the updated product data in the request body. Ensure that the request is properly formatted according to the API specifications.

### Provide Updated Data

Include all relevant information about the product that needs to be updated in the request body. This may include attributes such as name, description, price, and any other fields associated with the product.

### Handle Response

Upon successful submission of the PUT request, the system will respond with a confirmation message or relevant status code. Handle any errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure a smooth update process.

## Delete Product Data via API

To remove specific product data from our system, we've implemented a delete API. This API allows for straightforward deletion of product information by its unique identifier. Follow the instructions below to delete product data:

### Delete Product Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `/api/products/{product_id}`

Replace `{product_id}` with the unique identifier of the product you wish to delete.

### Request Method

Send a DELETE request to the designated endpoint with the product ID specified in the URL path. Ensure that the request is correctly formatted according to the API specifications.

### Handle Response

Upon successful submission of the DELETE request, the system will respond with a confirmation message or relevant status code indicating the success of the deletion operation. Handle any errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure proper handling of the delete operation.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage product data within our system using the provided API endpoints.
